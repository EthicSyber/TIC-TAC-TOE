A CLI version of the Tic-Tac-Toe (Naughts and Crosses) game. 

The game is played on a 3x3 grid where each player takes a turn placing their chosen mark (i.e., X or O). The origins of the game can be traced back to Ancient variations of the known game today. 

Generally, at least in my version. The X will go first no matter what piece is chosen. If you choose X you will start first, if you Choose O the computer takes X and starts first.

Example:

<div style="float:left; margin:0; padding: 0px 20px;">
    <img width='100' height='100' src="" alt='grid-play-1'>
    <img width='100' height='100' src="" alt='grid-play-2'>
    <img width='100' height='100' src="" alt='grid-play-3'>
    <img width='100' height='100' src="" alt='grid-play-4'>
</div>

The best play generally leads to a draw on both sides. Due to timing I am leaving the game like it is for now. It's pretty straightforward how to win as this doesn't completely take into account every situation. Although it does have some built in logic to attempt to thwart a clear victory (Needs an update for a better algorithm).
